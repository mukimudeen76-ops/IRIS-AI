# 🎯 What is Voice-First?

Traditional AI assistants are **text-first**: you type → they respond → you read.

IRIS is **voice-first**: you speak → they listen & execute → actions happen in real-time.

### Real-Time Audio Processing

```
Your Voice
    ↓ (WebRTC Stream)
Gemini 3.1 Live API (Real-time)
    ↓ (Intent Recognition)
LangGraph Agent Orchestration
    ↓ (Tool Selection)
Protected Tool Execution
    ↓ (System Actions)
Results Streamed Back to You
```

- **Latency:** < 500ms end-to-end (including network)
- **Quality:** Full duplex (talk while agent responds)
- **Models:** Gemini 3.1 Live API (primary) + Groq (Fast Responses) + Hugging Face (Open-Sourced + Local Models)
- **Search:** Tavily for real-time web data

No local-only limitations. IRIS connects to **cloud AI, search engines, and APIs** for maximum intelligence.

# 🔐 Code Protection & Security

## ⚠️ Important: Core Code is Protected

IRIS uses **enterprise-grade code protection** to secure proprietary agent logic and tool implementations:

### What is Protected?

✅ **Agent Core** (`iris-ai.ts`)  
✅ **Tool Implementations** (`tools.ts`)  
✅ **IPC Handlers** (`handlers.ts`)  
✅ **System Utilities** (All Main Process code)

### How It's Protected?

1. **V8 Bytecode Compilation**
   - TypeScript → JavaScript → Binary V8 bytecode
   - Result: `.jsc` files (unreadable, machine-specific)
   - Reverse engineering: 100+ hours of effort

2. **Protected Strings Obfuscation**
   - Sensitive strings transformed to obfuscated functions
   - Example: System prompts, tool definitions, API patterns
   - Grep/string search returns nothing useful

3. **ASAR Integrity Validation**
   - SHA256 hashing at build time
   - Runtime validation at app startup
   - Tampering detection: **App crashes immediately**

4. **Window Isolation**
   - Renderer windows cannot directly access each other
   - All inter-process communication via secure IPC bridge
   - No Node.js in renderer process

### Security Guarantees

- **100% BYOK** (Bring Your Own Key) – Your API keys, your control
- **Local Encryption** – Keys stored in OS keychain, never transmitted
- **Zero-Trust Architecture** – All inputs validated, outputs sanitized
- **No External Validation** – Core logic never phones home
